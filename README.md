# CYGNO Condor Queue

Submit jobs on CYGNO condor INFN Cloud queue

there are two way to submit job under the experiment queue:
1) acccess to cloud https://notebook.cygno.cloud.infn.it:8888/ open a terminal and follow the [istruction for Cygno Condor Cloud](https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/mycondor#cygno-condor-cloud)
2) download and install Docker for your platform [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and use Cygno Condor Container from your PC or server, etc. an then follow the [istruction for Cygno Condor Container](https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/mycondor#cygno-condor-container)

### Cygno Condor Cloud in your notebook (once forever)
to config once forever your condor eviroment open a terminal and edit your bashrc profile (whwre USER is your username):

    vi /jupyter-workspace/cloud-storage/USERNAME/.bashrc

copy and paste the following lines:

    # confiig conndor CYGNO queue
    cat > /etc/condor/condor_config.local << EOF 
    AUTH_SSL_CLIENT_CAFILE = /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/htcondor_ca.crt
    SCITOKENS_FILE = /tmp/token
    SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = SCITOKENS
    COLLECTOR_HOST = 131.154.96.173.myip.cloud.infn.it:30618
    SCHEDD_HOST = 131.154.96.173.myip.cloud.infn.it
    EOF

then (only first time afeter editing):

    source /jupyter-workspace/cloud-storage/USERNAME/.bashrc
      
save and exit (ESC: wq), then follow the istraction below to [submit a job](https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/mycondor/#submit-a-job). N.B. your profile .bashrc setup have to be recreated for any different container verision.

### Cygno Condor Container
download Cygno Condor Container configuration 

    git clone https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/mycondor.git
    cd mycondor/

in the directory ***private*** you will find example and there you have to copy/move your code to be submitted. The folder is shared with running container and continuosly updated

run Cygno Condor Container (first time it take some time to download the container image)

    docker-compose up -d
      
when up, connect via shell to the Cygno Condor Container 

    docker exec -it <image name> /bin/bash
     
<image name>  is tipicaly *mycondor-condor-1* or *mycondor_condor_1* depending your system. you can always get the name of the immage by the command **docker ps**:
                                                                                                   
       mycondor mazzitel$ docker ps
       CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS      NAMES
       d872b92ee256   dodasts/mini-htc:v0   "/bin/sh -c '/start_â€¦"   4 hours ago   Up 4 hours   9618/tcp   mycondor-condor-1 
      
then follow the istraction below to [submit a job](https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/mycondor/#submit-a-job)
      
### Submit a job 

ONLY on Container you need to get the tocken qith the command **gettoken** to the prompt

      [root@5045c42ec547 /]# gettoken

follow the istrctions and press enter to any question (do not enter any password), check if all is right e.g. monotoring the condor queue status

      [root@5045c42ec547 /]# condor_status
      Name                    OpSys      Arch   State     Activity LoadAv Mem   ActvtyTime

Now you are up and running. On in the container shell you can change directory to the shared folder with your PC where you can put your software. On the cloud you have to change the directory and upload via web interface your software/directory with your code. The **private** is permanent directory.

      cd private/

to access and test your code, follow the istructions below for more detteils: 

* condor@INFN [https://codimd.infn.it/s/VD3RWisM6#Submitting-a-demo-job](https://codimd.infn.it/s/VD3RWisM6#Submitting-a-demo-job)
* file IO [https://codimd.infn.it/s/pbisNdDlN](https://codimd.infn.it/s/pbisNdDlN)

***Tip on containers***: you can exit when you like from the contaner and reconnect with ***docker exec -it mycondor_condor_1 /bin/bash*** command; to stop the container (you actually can have it running forever) give de command ***docker-compose down***; all the files are shared via the local foleder ***mycondor/submituser*** also if you are not connected to the container; if you can't access the queues try first to refresh the token via ***gettoken*** command
